# 🎬 Netflix Data Analysis Project
This repository contains a data analysis project focused on exploring and visualizing Netflix’s content catalog using Python.

## 📊 Objective
To clean, analyze, and visualize the Netflix dataset to uncover meaningful insights about the platform’s content distribution, growth trends, and audience preferences.

## 🧰 Libraries Used
- **Pandas** – for data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy** – for numerical operations
- **Matplotlib** – for plotting graphs
- **Seaborn** – for advanced data visualization

## 📂 Dataset
- **File**: `netflix_datasets.csv`
- **Source**: Public dataset containing information on Netflix’s titles, including type, title, director, cast, country, date added, rating, duration, and genre.

## 🔍 Key Analyses Performed
1. **Dataset Cleaning**
   - Removed duplicates
   - Handled missing values
   - Converted date formats
   - Extracted year and month of content addition

2. **Data Segmentation**
   - Separated Movies and TV Shows for specific analyses

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Content count by type (Movie vs TV Show)
   - Year-wise content addition (2018–2021)
   - Top 15 directors on Netflix
   - Top 10 content-producing countries
   - Genre/category distribution
   - Ratings distribution
   - Movie duration histogram
   - TV Show season count
   - Pie chart of top content countries
