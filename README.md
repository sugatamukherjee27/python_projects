# 🎬 **Netflix Data Analysis Project**
This project dives into Netflix’s content catalog using Python to explore and visualize trends in its global library. 
It’s a hands-on analysis that reveals interesting insights about the platform's movies, TV shows, and how its content has evolved over time.

📊 **Objective**
The main aim is to clean, analyze, and visualize the Netflix dataset to understand things like:
1. What kind of content (Movies vs TV Shows) dominates the platform
2. How Netflix has grown over the years
3. Which countries and directors contribute the most
4. What genres and ratings are most common

🧰 **Libraries Used:**
To make this possible, I used the following Python libraries:
1. Pandas – for handling and analyzing the dataset
2. NumPy – for number crunching and transformations
3. Matplotlib – to create visual plots
4. Seaborn – for more advanced and aesthetic visualizations

📂 **Dataset**
- **File used** `netflix_datasets.csv`
- This dataset contains key details like title, type, director, cast, country, rating, duration, genre, and the date the content was added to Netflix.

🔍 **What I Performed:** 
1. Cleaned the data by removing the duplicates and filling in missing values
2. Converted dates into usable format, then extracted the year and month added
3. Seperated the data into Movies and TV Shows for more targeted insights
4. Explored :
   - Yearly growth
   - Top directors across the globe
   - Countries with most contents
   - Rating breakdown
   - TV seasons count
   - Pie chart of top countries producing Netflix content

📈 **Visual Insghts Included**
- Bar charts
- Histograms
- Count plots
- Horizontal bar graphs
- Pie charts

✅ **Conclusion**
Through this project, I learned how to extract meaningful insights from real-world data, clean and prepare datasets. It also gave me hands-on experience using some of the most essential data analysis libraries in Python.

📎 **How to Run**
1. Clone this repository.
2. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
3. Install required libraries seperately (already mentioned in Libraries Used). To install these, write 'pip install....'
